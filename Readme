*VERY IMPORTANT NOTE*
There is an over-write of an existing buffer in the message driver. This doesn't seem like it would normally occur in a program as it would be bad practice to write over a buffer that is in use by another funciton call.

If this is an error in the driver code, then the "message_no_copy" version of the message library removes the overhead of copying each buffer into a new buffer when it's added to the linked list.

By switching the names, you can run this version of the code.
